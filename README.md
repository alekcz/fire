# fire

A lightweight clojure client based using the Firebase REST API. 

## Usage

Write to the specified location (will overwrite any existing data):

```clojure
    (fire/write! "protected-db-name" "/path" {:map "with data"} auth)
    (fire/write! "public-db-name" "/path" {:map "with data"})
    ; => {:map "with data"}
```

Read data from the specified location:

```clojure
    (fire/read "protected-db-name" "/path" auth)
    (fire/read "public-db-name" "/path")
    ; => {:map "with data"}
```
 
 Update data at the specified location (only updates the specified fields):
 
```clojure
     (fire/update! "protected-db-name" "/path" {:more "data"} auth)
     (fire/update! "public-db-name" "/path" {:more "data"})
     ; => {:map "with data" :more "data"}
```
 
Add data at the specified location with an automatically generated key:

```clojure
     (fire/push! "protected-db-name" "/path" {:map "with data"} auth)
     (fire/push! "public-db-name" "/path" {:map "with data"})
     ; => {"name" "-IoZ3DZlTTQIkR0c7iVK"}
```
      
Delete at the specified locations:

```clojure
    (fire/delete! "protected-db-name" "/path" auth)
    (fire/delete! "public-db-name" "/path")
    ; => nil
```
